A stack datastructure implementation using queues.

To use the stack implementation in an existing project, you may include it as a composer dependency. 
More information on how to include a private project as a composer dependency can be found here https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path


To run unit tests on the project simply clone the project, run "composer install" followed by "vendor/bin/phpunit"
